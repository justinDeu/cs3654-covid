    "The COVID-19 pandemic has people flooding the internet with updates, facts, and opinions but peoples opinions can differ, change over time, align with their political parties or none of the above creating a lot of confusion. Now is not the time for indecisiveness, debate, and disagreement. The economy, people’s livelihoods, and most importantly people’s lives are at stake. \n",

    "Therefore, Group 3 will evaluate, and analyze the growth over time of the political relevance of COVID-19 as well as compare and contrast the sentiments and the perspective of the major political figures on the pandemic of both major political parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to know how have sentiments changed about the pandemic crisis over time generally and party-wise? How has the vocabulary changed? How different do Democrats and Republicans think? As well as how loyal are their members to their party’s viewpoints?\n",
